# Project Vitruvius

This game is meant for **two players** on a **single computer**! One player will control the Tetris board on the left and the other player will control the Breakout board on the right. Both players must cooperate to get a Breakout ball all the way to the top of the Tetris board.

Both boards are the **same board**, the Tetris board shows the top and the Breakout board shows the bottom, with a few rows of overlap.

Try it [here](https://vitruvius.gonguet.com/).
